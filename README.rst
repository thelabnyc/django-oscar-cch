Django Oscar CCH
=================

|  |license| |kit| |format| |downloads|

This package is to handle integration between django-oscar based e-commerce sites and the `CCH Sales Tax Office <http://www.salestax.com/products/calculations-solutions/sales-tax-office.html>`_ SOAP API.


Caveats
=======

1. You must fork the `order` application from Oscar to enable tax calculation as part of placing an order.
2. Persistence of tax details, while optional, requires that your project uses PostgreSQL. It relies on the HStore field.


Installation
============


1. Install the `instrumented-soap` and `django-oscar-cch` packages.::

    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/thelabnyc/instrumented-soap.git#r1.0.0
    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/thelabnyc/django-oscar-cch.git#r1.0.0

2. Add `oscarcch` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`::

    # myproject/settings.py
    ...
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.postgres',
        ...
        'oscarcch',
        ...
    ] + get_core_apps([
        ...
    ])
    ...

3. Add some attributes to `settings.py` to configure how the application should connect to CCH.::

    # myproject/settings.py

    # Add this is you need to connect to the SOAP API through an HTTP Proxy
    SOAP_PROXY_URL = ...

    # Configure the CCH WSDL location, entity, and division code
    CCH_WSDL = ...
    CCH_ENTITY = ...
    CCH_DIVISION = ...

    # Provide either a product SKU or a product group and item to send to CCH when calculating taxes
    CCH_PRODUCT_SKU = ...
    CCH_PRODUCT_GROUP = ...
    CCH_PRODUCT_ITEM = ...

4. Alternative to setting `CCH_PRODUCT_SKU`, `CCH_PRODUCT_GROUP`, and `CCH_PRODUCT_ITEM` globally, you can set them per-product by creating ProductClass attributes with the same names (in lowercase).

5. Install extra fields on order.models.Order and order.models.Line (see also `How to fork Oscar apps <https://django-oscar.readthedocs.org/en/releases-1.1/topics/customisation.html#fork-the-oscar-app>`_).::

    # order/models.py

    from oscarcch.mixins import CCHOrderMixin, CCHOrderLineMixin
    from oscar.apps.order.abstract_models import AbstractOrder, AbstractLine

    class Order(CCHOrderMixin, AbstractOrder):
        pass

    class Line(CCHOrderLineMixin, AbstractLine):
        pass

    from oscar.apps.order.models import *  # noqa

6. Create and run migrations for the `order` app.::

    $ python manage.py makemigrations order
    $ python manage.py migrate


7. Add the CCH mixin to `order.utils.OrderCreator`.::

    # order/utils.py

    from oscarcch.mixins import CCHOrderCreatorMixin
    from oscar.apps.order import utils


    class OrderCreator(CCHOrderCreatorMixin, utils.OrderCreator):
        pass


Usage
=====

`CCHTaxCalculator` is used to apply taxes to a user's basket.::

    from oscarcch.calculator import CCHTaxCalculator
    from oscarcch.models import OrderTaxation


    # Take a basket and the customer's shipping address and apply taxes to the basket. We can optionally
    # tolerate a failure to connect to the CCH server. In such a case, tax will be set to 0 and the method
    # will return none. In normal cases, the method will return the details of the taxes applied.
    cch_response = CCHTaxCalculator().apply_taxes(basket, shipping_address, ignore_cch_fail=True)
    is_tax_known = (cch_response is not None)

    # ...
    # Do other things necessary to convert the basket into an order
    # ...

    # Take the tax details generated earlier and save them into the DB.
    if is_tax_known:
        OrderTaxation.save_details(order, cch_response)

The `apply_taxes` method *always* sends a SOAP request to CCH. Is cases where you want to cache this call, for example, when exposing this functionality via an HTTP API, you can use the `estimate_taxes` method instead.::

    from oscarcch.calculator import CCHTaxCalculator

    # This method returns a (sometimes hydrated from cache) basket with taxes applied. The cache is invalidated
    # automatically whenever a the basket or one of it's lines is saved. See cch.handlers for details.
    basket = CCHTaxCalculator().estimate_taxes(basket, shipping_address)


Changelog
=========

2.1.0
------------------
- Remove caching functionality from CCHTaxCalculator.estimate_taxes since miss rate was almost 100%.
- Fix bug in tax calculation causing taxes to be calculated based on pre-discounted prices instead of post-discounted prices.
- Add optional basket line quantity override by checking for property `BAsketLine.cch_quantity`. Falls back to standard quantity if property doesn't exist.

2.0.0
------------------
- Renamed package to `oscarcch` for consistency. Set `db_table` option on models to prevent requiring table rename.
- Move tests inside `oscarcch` package.

1.1.1
------------------
- Fix bug where calculator could throw exception even when `ignore_cch_error` flag was set.

1.1.0
------------------
- Add the ability to set CCH product SKU, item, and group per-product in addition to globally.

1.0.5
------------------
- Add `CCH_TIME_ZONE` setting.
- Send time zone aware ISO format date as CalculateRequest InvoiceDate node. Formerly just sent the date.

1.0.4
------------------
- Truncate ZIP coes so that CCH doesn't choke when the user supplies a full 9-digit ZIP code.

1.0.3
------------------
- Improve unit tests by mocking all requests and responses. This allows running tests without a connection to an actual CCH server instance.
- Fixed bug where floats from SOAP response weren't properly converted into quantized decimals when saving `OrderTaxation` and `LineTaxation` models.

1.0.2
------------------
- Made `instrumented-soap` dependency optional.
- Moved gitlab testing from the shell executor to the docker executor.
- Added better usage documentation.

1.0.1
------------------
- Fixed an exception when `raven` isn't installed.

1.0.0
------------------
- Initial release.
